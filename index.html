              I think that life is
              the most fascinating naturally occurring
              phenomenon in the universe and I think
              that's uncontroversial I mean clearly
              the human brain is the most complex
              structure that we know of
              um it is a product to the laws of nature.
              but we are a long way from understanding
              how that produces the experience of
              living right and so really
              um if you want to ask what's the meaning
              of life then first of all we need to
              understand life and secondly we
              understand Consciousness because meaning
              emerges from consciousness.
            </span>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <span class="text-c">
              when we observe the diversity of life on
              Earth from the tiniest microorganisms to
              the most complex and diverse forms of
              plants and animals we see that they all
              share a fundamental characteristic they
              are composed of cells
              and then as we go through the fossil
              record and reconstruct the history of
              Life on our planet going farther and
              farther back we find that while early
              life was a bit simpler it was not only
              all Cellular in nature but that all life
              can be genetically traced back to what
              biologists call Luca or the last
              Universal common ancestor.

              life on Earth studying the fossil record
              and reconstructing past environments we
              find that all extant forms of life can
              be traced back to a single ancient
              origin

            <span class="text-c">
              but does that simply the very first
              life on Earth was a single cell and that
              all life came from that
              it's a fascinating possibility.

            <span class="text-c">
              when it comes to the question of what
              there first life on Earth was we'll have
              to first come to an agreement as to what
              actually defined life before we agree on
              an answer

            <span class="text-c">
              if you define life as something that
              needs to be cellular based then you'll
              conclude that there was no life until
              the first cell evolved
              it is widely believed that the first
              forms of life on Earth were simpler and
              more primitive preceding the development
              of cells by a certain amount of time
              these early forms of life likely
              possessed a primary metabolism and the
              ability to self-replicate laying the
              foundation for the emergence of more
              complex forms of life
              the only thing we can be absolutely
              certain of however is that all the life
              that exists today can be traced back to
              a common ancestor a little over three
              billion years ago
            </span>

            <br /><br /><br />
            beyond that there's still more science
            to be done in order to gain a deeper
            understanding of the origins of life.

            <div class="text-c">The nature of time is a complex and
              highly debated Topic in physics and
              cosmology
              from a classical perspective time is
              typically seen as an absolute Universal
              concept that flows uniformly and
              independently of other physical
              processes
              According to this view time is a
              dimension much like space in which
              events occur and can be ordered from
              past to Future
              however in the early 20th century the
              development of special and general
              relativity theories by Einstein
              fundamentally changed our understanding
              of time

            <br /><br /><br />
            <div class="text-c">
              according to these theories time and
              space are intimately connected and
              cannot be thought of as separate
              entities
              the passage of time is affected by
              gravity and motion and the rate at which
              time passes can be different for
              different Observers
              in addition to these classical and
              relativistic Views quantum mechanics
              also offers a different perspective on
              the nature of time
              in quantum mechanics time is not an
              absolute concept but rather an emergent
              phenomenon that arises from the
              interactions between Quantum systems
              in the theory of quantum gravity which
              attempts to unify quantum mechanics and
              general relativity time is seen as a
              relational concept that exists only in
              the context of other physical processes.

              some theories
              such as the Big Bang model suggest that
              time began with the initial expansion of
              the universe which is estimated to have
              occurred around 13.8 billion years ago
              however other theories suggest that time
              has always existed and did not have a
              beginning
              for example some theories propose the
              existence of a Multiverse in which our
              universe is just one of an infinite
              number of universes that have always

              in addition to these cosmological
              explanations there are also some
              theories from the [ realm ] of quantum
              physics that suggest that time and space
              may not be fundamental concepts but
              rather emergent phenomena resulting from
              more fundamental principles currently
              there is no consensus among scientists
              as to whether time had a beginning or
              not and further research will be needed
              to better understand the nature of time
              and its relationship to the universe.

              makes up only a small fraction of the
              total content of the universe the
              remainder which is estimated to account
              for about 95% of the universe's energy is
              composed of mysterious and Elusive

              There are many Mysteries surrounding
              dark matter and dark energy but there
              are also some facts that we can
              confidently state.
              One of these is that dark energy has an
              effect on the expansion of the universe
              and its presence and effects only become
              observable around six to nine billion
              years ago it appears to be the same in
              all directions it appears to have a
              constant energy density throughout time
              it appears to not Clump or cluster or
              anti-cluster with the matter indicating
              its uniform throughout space
              when we look at how the universe expands
              dark energy is absolutely essential for
              this process
              in contrast to Dark Energy the effects
              of dark matter have been present
              throughout the entire 13.8 billion years
              of the universe's history

              The observed large-scale structure of
              the universe including the formation of
              galaxies and Galaxy clusters can only be
              explained by the presence of dark matter
              which is estimated to be about five
              times more abundant than normal matter
              without it all that we observe would be
              impossible to explain
              the current state of our universe is
              dominated by dark energy but this is a
              relatively recent occurrence in the past
              the universe was smaller and more
              condensed resulting in higher densities
              of matter and radiation
              about 6 billion years ago the matter and
              dark energy densities were equal but
              about 9 billion years ago the dark
              energy density was low enough that its
              effect on the universe's expansion rate
              were not noticeable
              the farther we extrapolate back in time
              the more difficult it becomes to see and
              measure dark Energy's effects.

              Galaxies could be clusters of stars drawn together not just by gravity, but through the attractive force of gender and sex, as material is thrown across the cosmos to fertilise new stars, solar systems, and ultimately, life. And as humans are made from star dust, it may not just be a natural tendency to ascribe gender randomly, but a biological imperative to impart gender to the universe, because we humans have an intrinsic feeling that the universe is an gendered entity.

              According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10<sup>−32</sup> seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.

            Bring related theories with in a platform and we believe we have
            achieved that through our results. We would like to express our
            gratitude to Reji Ma'am for their guidance and support during this
            project.</span>
